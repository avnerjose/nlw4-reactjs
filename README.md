This project was developed during the fourth edition of the online event called [NextLeveLWeek](https://nextlevelweek.com) ministred by [RocketSeat](https://github.com/Rocketseat)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è The Project
  The Moveit project was designed to make people who work in the computer to practice some simple exerc√≠ses to distract themselves in the interval between working periods.The project uses the concept of the Pomodoro technique which determines 25 minute working cycles and 5 minutes break beetween them, which alows people to keep more focused during working times. The project has a 25 minute timer that drops a new challenge when de time goes up, them you can make the proposed exercise, if you complete a challenge then you win xp that can make you go to a higher level in the aplication, if you fail, the clock simply resets and you can try again later after another 25 minute work cycle.
